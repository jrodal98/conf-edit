# Conf-edit

An easy way to quickly edit your configuration files.

## About

I've gotten pretty deep into customizing my arch linux laptop.  This means having to regularly edit my i3 config, my zsh config, my polybar config, my st terminal config, and so on.  It got annoying having to type something like `nano ~/.config/i3/config` or `code ~/software/st/config.h` everytime I want to edit one of these files.  You could obviously add aliases for these, but that could get messy quickly.  Plus, you'd have to remember all of the aliases.

Introducing `conf-edit`.  Alias this once to something like `alias ce='~/Projects/conf-edit/conf-edit'` and start ricing in style.

## Usage

I will update this in the morning.  I'm too tired right now :)

If someone is actually reading this right now, that's kind of crazy.  Just wait like 24 hours or try to interpret the main method.
